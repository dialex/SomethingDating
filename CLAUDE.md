# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Start local dev server on port 3000 (required — file:// won't work)
npm test             # Run all Playwright tests
npm run test:ui      # Interactive Playwright test UI
npm run test:install # Install Playwright browser binaries (run once after clone)
npm run skills:install # Restore Claude Code skills from skills-lock.json
```

Run a single test file:
```bash
npx playwright test tests/navigation.spec.js
```

## Architecture

No framework, no build step. Plain HTML + CSS + vanilla JS, deployed to GitHub Pages.

**Data flow:** `index.html` loads `js/app.js` as an ES module → `app.js` imports `sections` from `js/workflow.js` → renders views based on module-level state → re-renders on user interaction.

**State** lives in `app.js` as module-level variables (`view`, `currentSectionId`, `currentStep`). Three views: `home` (section grid), `section` (step-by-step wizard), and `credits`.

**Folder layout:**
- `js/` — application logic (no markup beyond template strings for dynamic lists)
  - `workflow.js`, `phases/*.js` — pure phase data, no DOM
  - `app.js` — all rendering and navigation logic
  - `install.js` — PWA install banner (fetches the right `html/install-*.html`)
- `css/styles.css` — single stylesheet
- `html/` — static HTML partials fetched and injected by `app.js` / `install.js`
  - `credits.html`, `install-ios.html`, `install-android.html`
- `images/` — phase covers (`intro.jpg` etc.) plus `logo/` for app icons
- `service-worker.js` — cache-first offline strategy; `CACHE_NAME` must be bumped when assets change
- `manifest.json` — source of truth for app version (also synced in `service-worker.js`)

**Version** is auto-incremented on every commit via `.githooks/pre-commit` (patch bump in `manifest.json` and `service-worker.js`).

## Testing

- Write the test before the implementation (TDD).
- Test behaviour, not implementation — tests must not break on internal refactors.
- Playwright tests run against `http://localhost:3000` (config auto-starts the server).

## Content style (for `workflow.js`)

- **Titles**: sentence case (`"Sort your appearance"`, not `"Sort Your Appearance"`)
- **Instructions**: start with an imperative verb, end with a period
- **No** em-dashes (`—`), colons introducing explanations, or semicolons — split into multiple sentences instead
- **Parentheses** only for clarifications or examples

## Icons

Icons are inline SVGs taken from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/icons). Each one is preceded by an HTML comment marking its Lucide name, e.g.:

```html
<!-- lucide: chevron-left -->
<svg ...>...</svg>
```

To add or update an icon:
1. Visit `https://lucide.dev/icons/<name>` and copy the SVG markup.
2. Paste it inline at the call site, prefixed with `<!-- lucide: <name> -->`.
3. Strip the `class="lucide ..."` attribute and adjust `width`/`height` to fit the slot. Keep `stroke="currentColor"` so CSS `color` controls the icon.

Modal install-step icons live in `js/install.js` as a small `ICON` map of SVG strings (same convention).

No npm package is used — there is no bundler in this project, so we hand-copy paths from the Lucide source. If the icon set grows, consider installing `lucide-static` as a dev dep and adding a `build:icons` script that copies the SVGs we use into `js/icons/`.

## Deployment

Pushes to `main` auto-deploy to `https://dialex.github.io/SomethingDating/` via GitHub Actions. The service worker uses `/SomethingDating/` as the path prefix for all cached assets.
